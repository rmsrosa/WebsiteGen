### ⟩⟩⟩ **ICMC Summer Meeting on Differential Equations 2021**

On February 2, at 3pm, I am scheduled to give a talk at the Special Session on Fluid Dynamics, at the [ICMC Summer Meeting on Differential Equations - Chapter 2021](http://summer.icmc.usp.br/summers/summer21/). I will address my newest article, written jointly with [Roger Temam (Indiana University)](https://math.indiana.edu/about/faculty/temam-roger.html) and entitled "Optimal minimax bounds for time and ensemble averages of dissipative infinite-dimensional systems with applications to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations", currently availabe at [arxiv.org/abs/2010.06730](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06730).

### ⟩⟩⟩ **[UnitfulCurrencies.jl](https://github.com/rmsrosa/UnitfulCurrencies.jl)**

[UnitfulCurrencies.jl](https://github.com/rmsrosa/UnitfulCurrencies.jl) is a supplemental [Julia](https://www.julialang.org) package for [Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl), adding currency units and exchange rate tools.

### ⟩⟩⟩ **[JuliaBrewing](https://github.com/JuliaBrewing)**

The [JuliaBrewing](https://github.com/JuliaBrewing) github organization has been created, with the aim of writing a [Julia](https://www.julialang.org) package for the development of beer brewing recipes and related tools.
