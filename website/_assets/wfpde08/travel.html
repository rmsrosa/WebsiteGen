<h3>VISA Information</h3>

The Brazilian visa system operates under a strict reciprocity policy. That means 
that all citizens from Canada, Mexico, the United States and other countries 
that require visas from Brazilians will have to obtain visas to attend the 
conference. 
<br><br>

All foreign participants are strongly advised to check the 
<a href="http://www.brasilemb.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=42&Itemid=155">
visa page</a> of the <a href="http://www.brasilemb.org/">Brazilian Embassy in Washington, USA,</a> in order to determine whether and how to apply for a visa.
The <a href="http://www.brasilemb.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=181&Itemid=1">
list of nationalities that are exempt from this requirement</a>
includes the whole of the European Union and Mercosur. 
Those who do need visa should note that a tourist visa suffices for the conference;
visit the <a href="http://www.brasilemb.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=167&Itemid=1">tourist visa requirements</a>
page for detailed instructions and appropriate forms.
<br><br>

<h3>Arrival</h3>

Participants should plan to arrive at Galeão-Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport (GIG). See <a href="http://www.worldairportguide.com/airport/405/airport_guide/South-America/Rio-de-Janeiro-Gale%E3o-Antonio-Carlos-Jobim-International-Airport.html">this webpage</a> and <a href="http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=213">this one</a> for information about the airport and 
its services. It is suggested that you take a taxi to your hotel. We advise you to use the official taxis available at the airport booths before exiting the restricted area just after customs. The cost is about R$80.

<!--
The majority of ATMs only accept Brazilian-issued credit and debit cards. The ATMs at the international airport work, sometimes, but if they don't, you should exchange cash for the local currency (reais) at the airport kiosk to get taxi fare. Banks usually give the best rates, however, as in any large, metropolitan world-class city, it is not advisable to carry large amounts of cash on your person.
