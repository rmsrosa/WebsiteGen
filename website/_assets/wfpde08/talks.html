      <i>Title:</i> Computational visualization of Shnirelman's compactly supported weak solution</br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> We use computational tools to obtain an explicit approximation of Shnirelman's weak solution for 2D incompressible Euler equations on a torus, with compact support in time. in a joint work with A. Shnirelman we have obtained another weak solution for 2D incompressible Euler equations on a torus with more interesting physical structure. In both flows we have an illustration of the 2D inverse cascade.

      <i>Title:</i>  The asymptotic structure of turbulent separating flows over
smooth and rough wall.</br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> The proposed talk will touch on the two following research themes:
(i) the asymptotic structure of separating turbulent flows and (ii) the specification of the lower boundary condition for separating flows over rough walls. </br></br>
In the first part of the work, a direct application of Kaplun limits to the problem of turbulent separating flows is made so that simple arguments can be used to explain how the two-layered asymptotic structure of a turbulent boundary layer reduces to a new structure consistent with the local solutions of Goldstein and of Stratford at a point of zero wall shear stress. The present theory uses in addition a scaling algebraic equation that is derived from the first principles through some order of magnitude arguments. This equation respects the balance of terms in the x-momentum equation, yielding a characteristic velocity that is weighed accordingly to the local shear stress and pressure gradient effects at the wall. Local profiles for the mean velocity are developed in the near wall region for attached as well as reversed flow. All results are compared with some DNS and experimental data.</br></br>
In the second part, the present work investigates the lower boundary condition for flows over a steep, rough hill. The above simple asymptotic arguments together with the mixing-length hypothesis are used to derive a local analytical solution that is tested against three different flow conditions. The experiments were carried out in a water-channel and velocity measurements made through laser Doppler anemometry. In all, thirty six velocity profiles are compared with the proposed expression. The extent of
separated flow was observed to vary as a function of the roughness and the Reynolds number. The analysis includes regions of attached as well as separated flow. In particular, the solution of Stratford is studied at the points of separation and re-attachment and is found to apply equally well for rough walls.

      <i>Title:</i> Hydrodynamic interaction between rigid bodies</br></br>
      <i>Abstract: This talk begins with an overview on the physical origin
of forces and torques acting on rigid bodies moving in an incompressible
fluid. Then the speaker will report on his work on the
problem of hydrodynamic interaction of rigid bodies,
namely, the forces that two moving  rigid bodies cause on each other
due to the presence of the surrounding fluid.</i>

      <i>Title:</i> On vortex sheets on exterior domains and the Kelvin circulation 
theorem</br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> We are considering the problem of existence of distinguished sign vortex sheets on exterior domains. We are discussing the weak vorticity formulation of this problem and its relation with the validity of the Kelvin circulation theorem. This is joint work with M. Lopes, H. Nussenzveig Lopes and F. Sueur.

      <i>Title:</i> Chaotic behavior of solutions of the Navier-Stokes sytem in R<sup>N</sup></br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> We consider the Cauchy problem for the Navier-Stokes system, with locally integrable initial data u<sub>0</sub> &isin; R<sup>N</sup> such that |x||u<sub>0</sub>(x)| < <font face="symbol">e</font>, for all x&isin; R<sup>N</sup>, with <font face="symbol">e</font> small. We study the relationship between the long time behavior of u(t,&sdot;) and the asymptotic behavior of u<sub>0</sub>(x) as |x|&rarr; &infin;. In particular, we show that if the sequence <font face="symbol">l</font><sub>n</sub> u<sub>0</sub>(<font face="symbol">l</font><sub>n</sub>&sdot;) converges weakly to z(&sdot;) as <font face="symbol">l</font><sub>n</sub>&rarr; &infin;, then the rescaled solution t<sup>1/2</sup> u(t, t<sup>1/2</sup>&sdot;) converges uniformly in R<sup>N</sup> to S(1)z along the sequence t<sub>n</sub>=(<font face="symbol">l</font><sub>n</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, where S(t) is the Navier-Stokes flow.</br></br>

For N=2 or 3, we show that there exists an initial value U<sub>0</sub> such that the set attainable by U(t) in this fashion is a closed ball in an infinite dimensional space. Moreover, S(1) followed by the appropriate dilatation generates a chaotic dynamical system.

      <i>Title:</i> Asymptotic behaviour for the Navier-Stokes equations with delays terms</br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> We consider the Navier-Stokes equations with a time-delayed convective term and a forcing term which contains some hereditary features. Some results on existence and uniqueness of solutions are established. We discuss the asymptotic behaviour of solutions and we also show the exponential stability of stationary solutions.

      <i>Title:</i> Transport of interfaces with surface tension by 2D viscous flows</br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> We consider the problem of finding a global weak solution for two-dimensional, incompressible viscous flow on a torus, containing a surface-tension bearing curve transported by the flow. We construct a family of approximations and we show that this family is compact and possesses a weak limit which satisfies an incomplete set of equations. In addition, we give criteria for closure of the limit problem along with qualitative analysis of the solutions. Our work complements previous work of Helmut Abels. This is joint work with D. Ambrose, M. Lopes Filho and W. Strauss.

      <i>Title:</i> Vanishing viscosity with short wave long wave interactions for systems of conservation laws</br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> Motivated by Benney's general theory, we propose new models for short wave long wave interactions when the long waves are described by nonlinear systems of conservation laws. We prove  the strong convergence of the solutions of the vanishing viscosity and short wave long wave interactions systems by using compactness results from the compensated compactness theory and new  energy estimates obtained for the coupled systems. We analyse several of the representative examples such as scalar conservation laws, general symmetric systems, nonlinear elasticity, nonlinear electromagnetism. This is a joint work with J.-P. Dias and M. Figueira.

      <i>Title:</i> Vortices on surfaces</br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> One hundred and fifty years after Helmholtz' ``Wirbel'' paper the study of vortices on surfaces is still in its infancy, confined basically to the sphere or surfaces of revolution. As far as we know an intrinsic Hamiltonian formulation for the motion of point vortices on a closed (compact, boundaryless, orientable) surface with riemannian metric is in order. We hope to fill this gap. For the full version of this note, see arXiv:0802.4313v1 [math.SG].  Joint work with Stefanella Boatto (IM-UFRJ)

      <i>Title:</i> A numerical investigation of vortex induced vibration on an elastically mounted rigid cylinder </br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> The Vortex-Induced Vibration on an elastically mounted circular cylinder is investigated by the numerical solution of the two-dimensinoal Reynolds Aveaged Navier-Stokes equations and results are compared with experimental data. The upwind TVD scheme of Roe-Sweby is used to solve the governing equations and the k-epsilon turbulence model is used to simulate the turbulent flow in the wake of the cylinder. The cylinder is laterally supported by a spring and a damper and is free to oscillate in the transverse direction. Results for the lift coefficient amplitude, displacement amplitude, frequency, phase angle, and power absorbed by the system are presented and compared to experimental data. The code was tested for the fixed cylinder case, and for the moving cylinder. The comparison between the numerical results obtained in the present work and the experimental data, from the literature, showed that the numerical code was able to reproduce correctly not only the lift coefficient amplitude, displacement amplitude, frequency, and phase angle, but also important features of he vortex shedding modes such as the 2S and 2P modes of Williamson and Roshko.

      <i>Title:</i> Consistency of the relaxed solutions with the solutions of the
Euler equations </br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> We study a variational formulation, proposed by V. I. Arnold and by Y. Brenier, for the incompressible Euler equations with variable density. We consider the problem of minimizing an action functional, the integral in time of the kinetic energy, among fluid motions considered as trajectories in the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms beginning at the identity and ending at some fixed diffeomorphism at a given time. We proved that a relaxed version of this variational problem always has a solution, and we derived an Euler-Lagrange system for the relaxed minimization problem which we call the relaxed Euler equations.

In this talk, we will present results about consistency between the relaxed Euler equations and the classical Euler system, showing that weak solutions of the relaxed Euler equations with the appropriate geometric structure give rise to classical Euler
solutions and that classical solutions of the Euler system induce weak solutions of the relaxed Euler equations. The first consistency result is new even in the constant density case and the second is an extension of the work of Y. Brenier  to the variable density case.

      <i>Title:</i> A Minimalist turbulent boundary layer model</br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> Turbulent boundary layers, a subject of utmost importance in several applied fields is, despite long years of research, a very open problem in statistical physics. It is not only a matter of difficult experimentation and numerical inquiry; the non-linear and strong interactions that take place between coherent structures in such flows render the turbulent boundary layer problem a real theoretical challenge. We introduce an elementary model of the turbulent boundary layer over a flat surface, which takes into account recent experimental studies (in particular, the ones which are related to flow visualization techniques such as particle image velocimetry). The phenomenological description which we put forward has, as a main ingredient, a vertical random distribution of spanwise Lamb-Oseen vortex configurations placed over a non-slip boundary condition point at the surface. We are able, in this way, to obtain several important qualitative features of realistic flows, such as the viscous and logarithmic boundary sublayers, and the general behavior of the first statistical moments (the turbulent intensity, the skewness, and the kurtosis) of the streamwise velocity fluctuations. Furthermore, we address a heuristic discussion on the aspects of boundary layer kinematics that could be related to the physics of turbulent flows over rough surfaces and the phenomenon of drag reduction by polymers.

      <i>Title:</i> Interaction of instability waves and roughness to produce transition in boundary layers </br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> Roughness induced transition is an old and yet
unsolved problem in fluid mechanics. It is important because roughness and transition promote drag in airplanes and increase pollutant emission. Also, under normal conditions, a 1% reduction in drag may account for a 100% increase in profit for an airliner. Most studies focus on the effect of a roughenss in an otherwise unperturbed boundary layer. The search for the so called critical roughness height has been the main objective. This is however a very artificial scenario because in natural conditions the boundary layer exhibits instability waves, the so called Tollmien-Schlichting waves. The current work investigated the interaction of these waves with an isolated three-dimensional roughness. The work involved complicated experiments in wind tunnels.
It also provided a prediction model based on the secondary instability of the boundary layer. The results showed and explained that in such scenarios there is not a critical roughness height, but rather a critical amplitude of the Tollmien-Schlichting wave. This conclusion has very important implications on current procedures of airplane design.

      <i>Title:</i> Application of the monotone iterative method for a combustion problem in a porous medium</br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i> The monotone iterative method consists of an iterative process which yields approximating solutions for equations or systems of equations of parabolic or elliptic type with quasi-monotone nonlinearities. Starting with an upper solution or a lower solution the process provides a monotone sequence of functions that converges pointwise to a solution of the system. In this talk I will discuss the application of this method to two coupled reaction diffusion equations arising from the system modeling temperature and fuel concentrations in a porous medium derived by J.C. da Mota and S. Schecter (2006). We  assume that the fuel concentrations are giving functions. Then the corresponding reduced system have explicit upper and lower solutions for the Cauchy problem and the reaction functions are quasi-monotone nondecreasing. This is a joint work with J.C. da Mota.

      <i>Title:</i> Sharp estimates for turbulent flow </br></br>
      <i>Abstract:</i>  We derive upper and lower bounds for ensemble averages of energy, enstrophy, and palinstrophy for the 2D periodic Navier-Stokes equations.  This is done both in the general case, and in the case where the energy power law for fully developed turbulence holds.  In the turbulent case, the bounds are sharp, up to a logarithm, and provide a new lower bound on the Landau-Lifschitz degrees of freedom.  We also prove two properties of the inertial term under the turbulence assumption.  One is that as the Grashof number is increased, the ensemble average of this term approaches the force.  The other is that an estimate of it via Ladyzhenskaya's inequality is sharp on a considerable portion of the global attractor.

      <i>Abstract:</i> Complex fluids are fluids that interact with many small corpora they carry. Even in the absence of an ambient fluid, the equilibrium theory for melts of complicated corpora leads to interesting mathematical problems. I will present a mathematical framework and a few results in this area. I will also describe  a few results concerning coupled fluid-corpora systems.

      <i>Title:</i> On localization and geometric depletion of vortex-stretching in the 3D NSE</br></br>
      <i>Abstract: </i> In a recent work da Veiga and da Veiga and Berselli studied the geometric depletion of the vortex stretching term in 3D flows in domains with boundary (the previous works were all on the whole space).</br></br>

In the case of "non-standard" boundary conditions -- $u \cdot n = 0, \omega
\times n = 0$ on the boundary -- they obtained the results analogous to the
results on the whole space. The proof is based on representing the velocity
and consequently the vortex stetching term via the Green's function
of the Laplacian corresponding to the prescribed boundary condition.

However, this method doesn't fully extend to "standard" non-slip boundary
conditions -- in fact -- as noted by da Veiga, an additional assumption at the boundary controlling the normal derivative of the vorticity magnitude seems to be needed.

In this talk, a full spatio-temporal localization of the vortex stretching mechanism will be presented. This will imply a fully localized geometric depletion of the nonlinearity and hence regularity of any (geometrically constrained) weak solution up to the boundary independently of the type of the boundary condition.
