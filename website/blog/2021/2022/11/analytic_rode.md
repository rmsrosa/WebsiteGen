## Introduction

Random ordinary differential equations are directly related to [Stochastic differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation)
and are used in a number of models in a range of areas.

As in many complicate differential equations, numerical methods are of fundamental importance in the understanding such models and in using them in applications.
