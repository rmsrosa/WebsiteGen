## Outreach

* [![Cartaz](/assets/img/Pintcartaz_small.png)](/assets/img/Pintcartaz.png) In May 16, 2018, I participated in the [Pint of Science Brasil](https://pintofscience.com.br/), which is the Brazilian version of the [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.com/). This is a worldwide Festival in which Science is brought to the main public through discussions in selected bars and restaurants in the participating cities. The festival occurs once a year, always in May. My participation was together with Prof. Marcelo Viana (IMPA), on how Mathematics is behind the Science and Art of a good beer: *"Dois chopes e senta que lá vem história: como a matemática está por trás da ciência e da arte da boa cerveja"*.

* I am also the author of the *blog* [Cervejarte](http://www.cervejarte.org/blog), on which I write about beer production, particularly from the homebrewing perspective. It is more a hobby than a Mathematics outreach activity, but some of the posts are more technical, with more involved mathematical details, and which are presented in a form accessible to a more general audience.
