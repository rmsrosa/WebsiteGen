# Website Generator

This repository used to hold the source of my personal/work github website at [rmsrosa.github.io](https://rmsrosa.github.io). But after building it in `website/__site`, I had to manually push it to [rmsrosa.github.com repo](https://github.com/rmsrosa/rmsrosa.github.com.git).

Finally, in March 2024, and moved the source code to the [rmsrosa.github.com repo](https://github.com/rmsrosa/rmsrosa.github.com.git) and added a github action to automatically push the updates to the website (from the `gh-pages` branch), whenever the `main` branch of the repo was updated.
